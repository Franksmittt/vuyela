================================================================================

GOAL: Implement "Forensic Resource Orchestration" — Facade Pattern, Font 
Fallback Metrics, and Partytown offloading.

✅ COMPLETED TASKS:

1. FONT FALLBACK STRATEGY (Zero CLS)
   - Updated app/layout.tsx font configuration
   - Explicitly enabled adjustFontFallback: true for:
     * Inter font (--font-inter)
     * Playfair Display font (--font-playfair)
   - Set display: 'swap' for both fonts
   - Added detailed comments explaining CLS prevention
   - Ensures browser uses system font fallback that matches web font metrics
   - Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) during font loading

2. THE FACADE PATTERN (WidgetFacade)
   - Created components/WidgetFacade.tsx
   - Implements facade pattern for heavy third-party widgets:
     * Renders lightweight "fake" button (e.g., "Start Chat")
     * Looks exactly like the real widget

     * Swaps fake button for real Heavy Component
   - Ensures heavy JavaScript never loads during initial page load
   - Improves First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - Demonstrates lazy loading pattern for third-party scripts

3. PARTYTOWN INTEGRATION (Worker Offloading)
   - Installed @builder.io/partytown package

     * fetchPriority="low" for non-critical images
   - Ensures Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image loads with highest priority
   - Improves Core Web Vitals LCP score

KEY FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- components/WidgetFacade.tsx (new)
- components/ThirdPartyScripts.tsx (new)
- app/layout.tsx (updated - font fallback configuration)
- components/PageBuilder.tsx (updated - LCP image priority)

     a) Home Page Accessibility Test
        - Visits / and runs comprehensive Axe audit
        - Fails if any WCAG 2.2 AA violations found
        - Detailed violation logging for debugging
     
     b) Services Page Accessibility Test

        - Verifies keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.1.1)
        - Tests Escape key to close menu
        - Verifies focus returns after closing
        - Runs Axe audit on open menu state
        - Uses mobile viewport (375x667)
     
     e) Keyboard Navigation Test
        - Verifies all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
        - Tests Tab navigation through the page
        - Ensures no keyboard traps
     
     f) Color Contrast Test

        - Filters for color-contrast violations specifically
        - Tests both normal and large text requirements

4. NPM SCRIPTS

     * npm run test - Run all Playwright tests
     * npm run test:a11y - Run only accessibility tests
     * npm run test:ui - Interactive UI mode
     * npm run test:headed - Run with visible browser

5. ACCESSIBILITY VIOLATIONS FIXED
   
   a) Color Contrast Violations (WCAG 2.2 AA)
      - Problem: text-yellow-400 (#facc15) on white background had 
        insufficient contrast (1.53:1, needs 4.5:1 for normal text, 
        3:1 for large text)
      - Solution: Changed to text-amber-700 for better contrast
      - Files Fixed:
        * app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
          - Role labels (Executive Director, Managing Director)
          - Team member roles
        * app/(marketing)/page.tsx
          - Stats display (98.5%, 300+, 60+)
      - Result: All color contrast violations resolved
   
   b) Mobile Menu Escape Key Handling (WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard)
      - Problem: Menu didn't close when Escape key was pressed
      - Solution: Added keyboard event listener in components/header.tsx
      - Implementation:
        * useEffect hook listens for 'Escape' keydown events
        * Closes menu when Escape is pressed and menu is open
        * Properly cleans up event listener on unmount
      - Result: Full keyboard accessibility for mobile menu

AUTOMATED TESTING COVERAGE:
- Home page accessibility audit
- Services page accessibility audit
- About page accessibility audit
- Mobile menu interaction and focus management
- Keyboard navigation verification

ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY:
The test suite uses strict assertions:
  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);

This means ANY violation will fail the build, enforcing a zero-tolerance 
policy for accessibility issues.
